  <h2>Summary:</h2>

    <p> 
    I'm shifting from a Seller Support Associate to a web developer. 
    I've mainly used computers for games and movies, but now I'm passionate about technology. 
    I've completed an HTML course and built this website. I'm currently learning more with 
    "The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp" by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy. 
    I'm committed to becoming a software developer, even if I face challenges along the way. 
    I believe in learning and improving, no matter how many times I fail.
